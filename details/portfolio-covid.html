              <p>
                SingHealth’s Nursing Software Suite system development project, which seeks to provide an improved in-ward patient experience for patients, via giving patients access to up-to-date information about their medical condition and treatment process,  as well as increasing Nurses’ overall productivity
                Right from the start, our team dived deep in our process of creating a great user experience and took part in the original Apple Enterprise Design Lab (EDL) session, where we worked together with the SingHealth stakeholders at Apple’s Cupertino office to finalize the initial MVP scope of work. Along the way, we continued to work closely with the Singhealth stakeholders during the development phase to collaboratively and iteratively create a mobile application experience that truly address our end users’ pain points, be it patients or nurses. In the process, we were closely in touch with the Apple EDL team to ensure that our application not only meets, but exceeds the highest level of design guidelines recommended by Apple.
                Throughout the development, we managed to successfully iron out many technical issues faced while integrating with SingHealth’s EMR system, working closely with the IT Team from SingHealth to figure out what needs to be done. This will serve as invaluable experience for us moving forward, as we are in a prime position to be able to foresee and minimize the barrier in terms of integrating with the other additional systems in the next phases of application.
                Equally importantly, our experience working on the MVP 1.0 version gives us a much deeper understanding of the nuances and kinks in a patient’s daily flow when using the application eg. reflective surface of the bar code tag, and also understand what are potential workflow pains faced by the nurses. These are learnings that we feel will benefit us greatly when working on the next phase of the application development.
